            <h1>A Christmas Carol</h1>
            <p>The woman sitting across from Connor Reid had broken the silence of an otherwise
                client-free evening. Beneath her perfect sculpture of dark brown hair,
                the woman&rsquo;s green eyes sparked with an equal measure of anger and fear. Connor
                was used to a healthy dose of anger directed his way, but fear, that was something new.
                He watched her slim, well-manicured fingers raise a cigarette to her lips.
